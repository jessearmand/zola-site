About 13 years ago, [software was eating the world](https://a16z.com/why-software-is-eating-the-world/), and just last month [taste is eating Silicon Valley](https://www.workingtheorys.com/p/taste-is-eating-silicon-valley). As the author, Anu Atluru of the post said [*taste is eating software, taste is the new weapon*](https://www.workingtheorys.com/i/149057938/taste-is-eating-software-taste-is-the-new-weapon). While I won't pretend to fully understand what's happening, I can observe what has happened to software and speculate on what it might become.

We have software running on:

* Mainframes, data centers, compute platforms, on-premise servers
* Personal computer, laptop
* Cars, Aircraft, drones
* Appliances
* Smartphones, cameras, and any portable devices

As software engineers we have seen that software was built based on the cultural markets they serve. For some regions, such as Asia or Europe, Apple and Tesla are considered overpriced brands. For some other regions, mostly in North America, Apple and Tesla are commonplace, and their cultural identity. 

But, if I think about it, that has been the evolution of software since the beginning. It's not enough to build just a functional software, we have to create a wrapper on top of it, packaging it as something that an individual or a business would like to use. Taste and culture have been factors of how software gets adopted regardless of its technical quality.

Now, what is actually my observation?

To understand the current state of software evolution, it's crucial to distinguish between two key components: *infrastructure layer* and *presentation layer*. While both are essential, they're evolving at dramatically different rates.

The infrastructure layer, has been remarkably resistant to change. This stability is evident across various sectors: 

* Financial transaction running on banks or trading platform will hardly ever get changed without a drastic push. Did you remember when bitcoin paper was published? From what I found, it's published on 31 October 2008. 
* Financial technology has been building on top of existing payment infrastructure.

Regardless of what you think about the underlying technology, cryptocurrencies also have been associated with fraud and scam. Because, most cryptocurrencies don't interoperate with the backbone of the payment system, it doesn't have enough utility to justify that there's a good side from all of them. It's not enough to run a decentralized wallet, it has to interoperate. This is just one example, because I had some working experience at a fintech company.

I believe that's the case for other industries, they are mostly running legacy software, that has been working well for many years. It's very hard to create an incentive to refresh the whole system, and it's extremely hard to actually work on a new software system that could replace them. There's a reason why Tesla is still the leader in automobile software revolution, and has only recently been followed by Chinese companies. That's also influenced by the ability of Chinese companies to source manufacturers from within China, and be able to streamline all the software and hardware running on them.

The presentation layer is where the rapid advancement occurs. When software was eating the world, the iPhone had just come out with iOS. I believe it wasn't until Android became widespread that we started to see smartphones and mobile apps being used by almost everyone, regardless of gender, race, or nationality

What's specifically happening in San Francisco is the proliferation of generated user interface from language models or what we'd like to call AI. 

It's the new presentation layer, and as always presentation layer is where we can always iterate upon and change, without causing a lot of damage in the society. I know that AI is supposed to be the brain, but more accurately, it's a detached brain. A brain / mind living outside the body of its host. It can be a ghost, holy spirit, or even a virus, depending on your belief system. That's my skeptical but realistic take on the current state of LLMs.

The industry leader in AI have big plans for the growth of intelligence (as they've always been), but at the same time people are still debating on what they actually need or want from it. However, I would encourage anyone to take an in-depth reading into Dario Amodei's [Machines of Loving Grace](https://darioamodei.com/machines-of-loving-grace). I think it's quite an honest, intriguing, and grandiose vision of what AI will become.

But, from the point of view of software engineers / developers, most of the innovation still occurs only at the presentation layer. That is user interface, AR / VR environment, AI agents that interact with our legacy system. It takes a major investment push and cultural shift to see it happening elsewhere.
