A self-taught software engineer from computer and control systems education background.

I am working as a Senior Software Engineer at [Screening Eagle](https://screeningeagle.com/) Singapore.

I have been working on iOS platform since 2008. At that time, I was fascinated and intrigued by the iOS when Apple released the first SDK to developers all over the world with iPhone being hackable and having the same base system as OS X.

Since then, I have worked mostly on mobile applications development on iOS, and will continue to do so for the native / web platform. In general, I'm looking forward to the potential of Swift development ecosystem as a full stack platform, in addition to macOS / iOS. However, throughout the years I have also dedicated some time into engineering work that is not necessarily specific to Apple's platform. 

But, on the frontend side basically there are only 3 choices available in order to make a career out of it. That is the *browser* which we call *the web* and Android or iOS on a mobile device or smartphone. Apart from that, it's likely that a VR headset such as Oculus Rift would become the next *frontend*, human interactions may no longer require physical presence. People will need a better interface to interact with the outside world and with each other.

As an analog to VR, an FPV headset is a cheaper and practical system that has been used by hobbyists and professionals. This is especially apparent in drone racing or FPV cinematic, and we can obviously see its application in robotics or any remote sensing application, where you need a live video feed of a remote operation. AR which is now popular in smartphones, will have a better form as a headset. If we couple a digital FPV headset with augmented reality layer, we would have a much better experience. As a company like [Orqa](https://orqafpv.com/) refers to this system as *Remote Reality*.
