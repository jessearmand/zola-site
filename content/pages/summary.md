This page provides a summary of the key topics and their chronological evolution as explored in my blog posts.

Starting in April 2020, my posts reflect a deep dive into the FPV drone hobby. I explored the nuances of ["Freestyle or Racing?"](@/2020-04-26-Freestyle-or-Racing.md) (2020-04-26), detailing the structured goals of racing versus the freeform creativity of freestyle, and the surprising difficulty of competitive simulation even for a beginner. I then shifted focus to the hardware, discussing the pros and cons of different drone sizes in ["Micro or Mini quad?"](@/2020-10-26-Micro-or-Mini-quad.md) (2020-10-26), highlighting the practical advantages of smaller drones for accessibility in urban environments and the confusing mix of metric and imperial units in the hobby. By May 2021, in ["It has been a long time"](@/2021-05-31-It-has-been-a-long-time.md) (2021-05-31), I reflected on building my own quads, sharing detailed lessons learned from troubleshooting electronics on high-powered setups, emphasizing the critical importance of clean wiring, proper configuration, and understanding electrical phenomena when dealing with hardware at a low level.

After a break, my posts transition significantly towards the world of AI and software. In ["Why Language?"](@/2023-04-16-Why-Language.md) (2023-04-16), I explored the power of the Transformer architecture and the role of language in human and artificial intelligence, reflecting on how advancements like GPT enable new ways of processing information and generating knowledge. This marked a clear pivot towards generative AI. By October 2024, my focus broadened to the software industry itself in ["What's happening with software?"](@/2024-10-13-whats-up-with-software.md) (2024-10-13), where I analyzed the distinction between the slow-evolving infrastructure layer and the rapidly changing presentation layer, speculating on how AI-generated UIs and agents represent the new frontier in software interaction. Most recently, in ["How to Add a Chat Interface to Zola Static Site Generator"](@/2025-06-05-how-to-add-chat-to-zola.md) (2025-06-05), I demonstrated a practical application of my AI interest by building a chat interface for my static site, detailing the technical implementation challenges and solutions, including secure API interaction via serverless functions â€“ a clear example of bridging static content with dynamic AI capabilities and showcasing my ability to learn and implement new technologies.

This chronological view reveals a path from hands-on hardware and hobbyist electronics, which instilled a grounded understanding of software's physical interactions, towards a deep engagement with cutting-edge AI concepts, particularly language models and their potential to reshape software interfaces and knowledge creation.
